#Machine Learning Classification Algorithms
Classification algorithms are used to categorize data points into predefined labels. Key algorithms include:

Logistic Regression: Predicts binary outcomes using a linear approach.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies based on the nearest neighbors in the dataset.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Finds the best boundary to separate classes.
Decision Trees: Splits data into branches to make decisions based on feature values.
Random Forest: Combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.
Naive Bayes: Uses probability based on Bayes' theorem and assumes feature independence.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Sequentially builds trees to correct errors from previous trees.
XGBoost: An optimized version of gradient boosting known for its efficiency.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Mimic the human brain to learn complex patterns.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized in processing image data.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Effective for sequential data such as time series.
