# Machine Learning Classification Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of classification algorithms applied to the Titanic dataset. The goal is to explore and evaluate different machine learning models for classification tasks.

## Files

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `classification.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing code for implementing and evaluating various classification algorithms.
- `titanic_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluating the models.

## Dataset

The `titanic_dataset.csv` file contains information about passengers on the Titanic. It includes features such as age, sex, class, and whether or not the passenger survived. This dataset is used to train and test classification models.

## Models

The following classification algorithms are implemented and evaluated in the `classification.ipynb` notebook:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git
